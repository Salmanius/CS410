1.By default: if there is no material specified at the beginning of the .obj ("mtllib MTLFILENAME"), there are no materials used
2.By default: if there is no "usemtl MATERIALNAME" in the .obj faces section, all faces use the first material  of the materials file.
3.Parse the materials file as soon as it is found so it can be referenced later
4.Do not trust the material number comment made by blender in the mtl file.
5.Read in all materials in an arraylist for use.
6.Default is first material, current is set as default at first, but can be changed later.
7.Current is changed for faces by "usemtl MATERNAME" and so all faces after it will use that until set again
8."usemtl MATERIALNAME" uses it's own line
9.Faces should store an index from the materials list and a materials name for use later and human readable name
10.Break on new material in the mtl file based on after keyword "illum" or when hitting keyword "newmtl"
11.Set default phong value (aka "Ns") to 16
12.ignore Ni and d values for the time being
13.Save Ke values but arent used right now.
